# Data Structures And Algorithm

## Important Points

First of all, I would like to tell **STACK**, **QUEUE** and **GRAPH** structure.
</br>
- Stack properties are;
FILO, First In Last Out. If we want to add variable into the stack, we should use push() method, if we want to delete the variable, so that method named
pop(). There is one more specific method, it's named peek(). That method provide to display the variable, if it's including into the stack.
- Now let's continue with Queue;
This time rule is FIFO(First In First Out). Adding method name is **ENQUEUE**. Deleting method name is **DEQUEUE**.

### Dfs And Bfs Algorithm

I've made simple example including **DFS** and **BFS** algorithm. These are searching algorithm. **DFS** is using **STACK** structure. **BFS** is using
**Queue**. You reach out the source code from below the link;

</br>

### Dijkstra Algorithm

And lastly, I would likte to share **Dijkstra** algorithm. That algorithm provide to find the shortest path into the weighted graphs. You can reach it from
below the link;
